(FIX DISK LOAD SIZE ERRORS)

network/tcp:
  build TCP architecture (sliding window, control informations, .....)

  now, tcp needs a flow control/sliding window protocol. need to implement that too
  handlers for ignored tcp flags (optional)
  dynamic MSS (optional)

network/ARP:
  ADD ARP TABLE ENTRY WHEN WE RECEIVE A PACKET FROM AN UNKNOWN HOST

network:
  check every function error return code

network:
  GET MAC_ADDR FROM ARP TABLE
  stack is overflowing when too many tasks
    interrupt process is using the stack of the previous task (it's a good idea to use the "0xf00000" stack;

network/IP:
  create a mac/ip checks on distinct functions
  FRAGMENTATION
