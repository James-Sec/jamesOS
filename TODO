network/architecture
  NETWORK STACK ISN'T FIRING INTERUPT WHEN A MESSAGE ARRIVES, BUT MESSAGES ARE BEING WRITTEN TO MEMORY.
    scenario: ping after an ARP (ping -I tap0 1.2.3.4)

    hint: create a thread for each message handle

      


network/ICMP(bugged):
  ARP PACKET INSIDE ICMP REPLY DATA
    probably error on pointer handling on multiple received packets

network/ICMP:
  GET MAC_ADDR FROM ARP TABLE
  REVIEW "IDENTIFIER" AND "SEQUENCE NUMBER" FIELDS IN ECHO REQUEST/REPLY

network/IP:
  create a mac/ip checks on distinct functions

network:
  FREE() PACKETS;
  VERIFY WHEN UNLOCK INTERRUPTS.

network/ARP:
  ADD ARP TABLE ENTRY WHEN WE RECEIVE A PACKET FROM AN UNKNOWN HOST

network/IP:
  FRAGMENTATION

drivers/pit:
  ADD GET_TIME FUNCTION
