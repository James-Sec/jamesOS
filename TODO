network/UDP:
  udp buffer error
  scenario: sending multiple message then sending just one and printing its contents
  we think that the rtl8139 is receiving all the packets (or almost all) but it is not generating all the interrupts. We have to test it and if it is true, we have to handle it in the rtl8139 driver, reseting and discarting this packets for example. 

network/ARP:
  ADD ARP TABLE ENTRY WHEN WE RECEIVE A PACKET FROM AN UNKNOWN HOST

network:
  check every function error return code

network:
  GET MAC_ADDR FROM ARP TABLE
  stack is overflowing when too many tasks
    interrupt process is using the stack of the previous task (it's a good idea to use the "0xf00000" stack;

network/IP:
  create a mac/ip checks on distinct functions
  FRAGMENTATION
