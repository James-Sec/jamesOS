network/architecture
  after a while of receiving packets the OS simply reset or freeze
  something deterministic is happen. The stack adrress is something around 0x128000 (it should be an address of a task) and the full size of packets received is something around 7770, 7834
  test to do: reset the ring buffer after a while

interrupts:
  interrupt process is using the stack of the previous task (it's a good idea to use the "0xf00000" stack;

network/UDP?

network/ICMP:
  GET MAC_ADDR FROM ARP TABLE
  REVIEW "IDENTIFIER" AND "SEQUENCE NUMBER" FIELDS IN ECHO REQUEST/REPLY

network/IP:
